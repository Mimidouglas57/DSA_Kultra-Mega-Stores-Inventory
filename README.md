üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) ‚Äî a Nigerian retailer of office supplies and furniture ‚Äî focusing on its Abuja operations from 2009 to 2012. The goal is to uncover trends in sales, customer behavior, product performance, and shipping efficiency.

Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, the analysis answers key business questions around top-selling products, most valuable customers, regional performance, and cost-effective shipping. The insights support strategic decisions to boost revenue, optimize logistics, and better serve customers.
 
## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis was provided by Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) and includes detailed order records from **2009 to 2012**, specifically from the **Abuja division**. It is structured across two CSV files:
- KMS SQL Case Study.csv
- Order_Status.csv

  ## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

The raw order data was cleaned and transformed to enable accurate analysis. Key steps included:

- **Merged Datasets:** Combined orders and return status using `Order ID`.
- **Formatted Dates:** Standardized date format and extracted year/month.
- **Handled Missing Values:** Checked for and resolved any nulls in key fields.
- **Corrected Data Types:** Ensured numerical and categorical fields were properly typed.
- **Removed Duplicates:** Eliminated duplicate order records.
- **Created New Fields:** Added `Order Year`, `Order Month`, and `Return Flag` columns.
- **Standardized Regions/Provinces:** Fixed inconsistencies in location names.

These steps ensured the data was clean, consistent, and ready for SQL, Excel, and Power BI analysis.
