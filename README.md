Case Scenario I Insights

1. **Top Category:**  
   Technology is the highest revenue-generating category (₦5.98M). Recommend focusing promotions and stock on this category.

2. **Regional Sales:**  
   West, Ontario, and Prarie are the top-performing regions.  
   Nunavut had the lowest sales (₦116k) — consider geo-targeted awareness campaigns.

3. **Zero Sales Category:**  
   No appliance sales in Ontario — investigate if it's a supply chain or product-market fit issue.

4. **Low-Spending Customers:**  
   Bottom 10 customers spent less than ₦500. Recommend offering loyalty discounts or bundling strategies to increase spend.

5. **Shipping Cost Drivers:**  
   Delivery Truck has the highest shipping cost, likely due to volume. Monitor cost-effectiveness in low-margin transactions.
